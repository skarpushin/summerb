/**
 * Use it when you don't want to impl the whole stack of interfaces and classes
 * of Easy CRUD, when you just need to execute one custom query.
 * 
 * Add this attribute to the method of custom sub-interface of
 * {@link EasyCrudService}, impl of which is instantiated by @link
 * EasyCrudScaffold} (instead of defining class that implements this interface)
 * 
 * Then you can easily define new query to the underlying database.

 * This is normally implemented by {@link ScaffoldedMethodFactoryMySqlImpl}, but
 * could be easily overridden, by injecting custom
 * {@link ScaffoldedMethodFactory} into {@link EasyCrudServiceProxyFactoryImpl}

 * of the storage layer, I still believe that this "convenience shortcut" worth
 * a shot.
