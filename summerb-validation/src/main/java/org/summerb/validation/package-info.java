/**
 * This package contains core design and impl for validation of input/data. It is primary strong
 * side compared to other approaches is super easy to use and also transparency it gives --
 * validation related to particular entity is contained in 1 place and easily readable and
 * augmentable.
 *
 * <p>It doesn't operate with human-readble text, instead it operates upon message codes (see {@link
 * org.summerb.i18n.HasMessageCode}.
 *
 * <p>Also, it supports validation of hierarchical structures.
 *
 * <p>Start with an empty instance of {@link org.summerb.validation.ValidationContext}, call out-of
 * the box methods or add validation errors manually using {@link
 * org.summerb.validation.ValidationContext#add(ValidationError)}. And then call {@link
 * org.summerb.validation.ValidationContext#throwIfHasErrors()} to throw well-structured exception
 * containing all errors collected.
 *
 * <p>In case needed to return to REST client, use {@link
 * org.summerb.validation.FieldValidationException#getErrorDescriptionObject()}
